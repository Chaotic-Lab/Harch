# Harch {Hackers Arch} - A quick(depending on Internet Speed), simplistic Arch box with a small portion of powerful hacking tools, a badass lightweight hacker OS!

Harch is intended for experienced Security Professionals. The tools at your disposal are powerful in the right hands! The lightweight design speeds up install time as well not having unneeded applications taking up precious resources! Arch is what some people call "not user friendly" though I disagree, Arch is by far a user friendly OS (If you want to learn WTF is going on).

Harch = A 'really' basic script install for Arch Linux BIOS/UEFI systems
  To install, boot into Arch live ISO and:
  
  
    1. curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaoticHackingNetwork/Harch/main/Harch
    2. chmod +x Harch
    3. ./Harch
    * Some systems show a bad meterpreter if so run: sed -i -e 's/\r$//' Harch 
    4. After Harch install, it will download HarchPOST
    5. arch-chroot /mnt
    6. chmod +x HarchPOST
    7. ./HarchPOST

Tools will be broken down into categories for a more user preferred system, not every tool is needed. MORE TOOLS COMING SOON!!!

    2. Cracking-Tools = PW Cracking tools , i.e Hydra, Hashcat etc...
    3. Forensic-Tools = Tools for Forensics, i.e. Maltego, Steghide etc...
