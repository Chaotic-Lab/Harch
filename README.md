# Harch {Hackers Arch} - A quick(depending on Internet speed), simplistic Arch box with a small portion of powerful hacking tools, a badass lightweight hacker OS!

Harch is intended for Linux Security Researchers, preferably those who want to get into Ethical Hacking but have an old or slow system... The tools at your disposal are powerful in the right hands! The lightweight(If you choose) Arch design speeds up install time as well not having unneeded applications taking up precious resources!

Harch = A 'really' basic script install for Hacking with Arch Linux on a BIOS/UEFI system.
  To install, boot into Arch live ISO and:
  
  
    1. curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaoticHackingNetwork/Harch/main/Harch
    2. chmod +x Harch
    3. ./Harch
    * Some systems show a bad meterpreter if so run: sed -i -e 's/\r$//' Harch 
    4. After Harch install, it will download HarchPOST
    5. arch-chroot /mnt
    6. chmod +x HarchPOST
    7. ./HarchPOST

Tools will be broken down into categories for a more user preferred system, not every tool is needed. MORE TOOLS COMING SOON!!!

    1. Web-Tools = Web App and Wireless Tools, i.e. Metasploit, Dirbuster etc...
    2. Cracking-Tools = PW Cracking tools , i.e Hydra, Hashcat etc...
    3. Forensic-Tools = Tools for Forensics, i.e. Maltego, Steghide etc...
